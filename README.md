# AccessFi

**A Privacy-First Internet-Verifiable Data Marketplace**

AccessFi is a next-generation protocol that bridges Web2 data with Web3 trustlessness. Users prove they have specific data (like subscription receipts, ratings, activity history) using zero-knowledge proofs and secure hardware, without revealing private details. Businesses get cryptographically verified data that is 100% legal and privacy-compliant.

## The Problem

Companies currently buy data from shady brokers or scrape it without permission. They cannot verify data authenticity without accessing personal information. Users get zero reward for their own data, and privacy is constantly leaked.

## How AccessFi Works

1. **Users** prove they have specific data (e.g., Spotify Premium subscription, high Uber rating) using **zkEmail** and **Phala TEE** without showing private details
2. **Businesses** create Data Pools with specific rewards for verified data types
3. **Smart Contracts** automate instant payment when verified data is locked in the secure vault
4. **Buyers** receive cryptographically guaranteed, encrypted, privacy-compliant data
